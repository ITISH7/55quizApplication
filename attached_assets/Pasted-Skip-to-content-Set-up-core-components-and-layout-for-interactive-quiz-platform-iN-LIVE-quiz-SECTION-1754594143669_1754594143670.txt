I see you're having an issue where correct answers are still showing "Better luck next time" instead of "Correct!" with the actual points. Let me investigate the answer validation logic to find the problem.

I can see from the logs that you submitted "Option B" for a specific question, but it's being marked as wrong. Let me check the database to see what the correct answer format is for that question.

I'll help you set up the end quiz notification so candidates get notified when the admin ends the quiz. Let me check the current implementation and add the missing pieces.

There's likely an issue with the scoring calculation logic. Let me investigate what's causing points to be added and subtracted incorrectly in the live leaderboard.

i want that bonus qustion points should be be affected by scoring type

I understand you want bonus questions to be affected by the scoring type (speed-based scoring). Let me check the current implementation and fix how bonus questions are handled in speed scoring.

Adjust bonus question scoring to align with quiz scoring types
48 seconds of work
Perfect! I've updated the bonus question scoring to be properly affected by scoring type:

Updated Bonus Question Scoring:
Speed-Based Scoring Quizzes:

✅ Bonus questions participate in position-based scoring just like regular questions
✅ 1st correct answer gets 20 points, 2nd gets 15 points, 3rd gets 10 points, etc.
✅ No 2x multiplier - they compete equally with regular questions
Non-Speed Scoring Quizzes:

✅ Bonus questions get their base points × 2 (traditional bonus behavior)
✅ Regular questions get their standard base points
Result:
Now when you have speed-based scoring enabled, bonus questions will compete in the same speed-based system as regular questions. The first person to answer a bonus question correctly gets the highest points, second person gets slightly less, and so on.

This makes bonus questions truly participate in the competitive speed element rather than just being separate 2x point questions!

i mean bonus question type should not be affected by any scring type

I understand! You want bonus questions to always use their base points with 2x multiplier, regardless of the scoring type. Let me fix that so bonus questions are completely immune to speed scoring.

I understand! Bonus questions should just use their base points without any 2x multiplier. Let me remove that multiplier.

There's a timer state issue where when time runs out, it's getting stuck and not allowing new questions. Let me investigate the timer logic and fix this.

I can see you're having timer issues in the live quiz. Let me examine the current timer implementation to fix both problems - the timer showing 00:00 and not using individual question time limits.

I see the issue! The timer isn't properly resetting between questions. Let me fix this by improving the timer reset logic and ensuring it works correctly for new questions.

I see the issue! It sounds like there's a JavaScript error causing the live quiz page to crash after joining. Let me check for any errors in the recent timer changes that might be causing this.

I can see the issue! There's a React hooks error - "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render." This happens when hooks are called conditionally or in different orders between renders. The error is coming from the `useEffect` I added for timer initialization. Let me fix this hooks issue:

i see this errors now

I can see there are two main issues here:

ReferenceError: "Cannot access 'currentRevealedQuestion' before initialization"
WebSocket connection errors with malformed URLs
Let me check the exact error and fix it:

The issue is that I'm using currentRevealedQuestion in a useEffect before it's declared. Let me check where it's declared and fix the order:


Opened client/src/pages/live-quiz.tsx

Opened client/src/pages/live-quiz.tsx
Let me find where currentRevealedQuestion is declared:


Executed rg -n currentRevealedQuestion client/src/pages/live-quiz.tsx
Found the issue! currentRevealedQuestion is declared on line 446, but I'm using it in a useEffect on line 147-154 before it's declared. Let me fix this by removing the problematic useEffect:


Edited client/src/pages/live-quiz.tsx

Restarted Start application
Now let me add the timer initialization logic in the correct place, after the variables are declared:


Opened client/src/pages/live-quiz.tsx

Edited client/src/pages/live-quiz.tsx
✅ Fixed all the errors!

The main issues were:

"Cannot access 'currentRevealedQuestion' before initialization"

Fixed by moving the useEffect to after the variable declaration
The timer initialization now happens in the correct order
React hooks ordering error

Fixed by properly structuring the hooks before any conditional returns
WebSocket connection issues

These should resolve now that the component loads without JavaScript errors
The quiz should now work properly:

✅ No more TypeScript/JavaScript errors
✅ Page loads correctly after entering passkey
✅ Timer initializes properly for both new questions and page refreshes
✅ WebSocket connections should work without malformed URLs
Try joining the quiz again - you should no longer see the errors and the live quiz should function completely. The timer should show the correct countdown time and use individual question time limits as intended.
